badproxy
========

After reading about HTTP failure modes in [Release It](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers-ebook/dp/B00A32NXZO/ref=sr_1_1) I decided to try writing a proxy that would reproduce those bad behaviours.

I didn't get very far though... I heard about [Vaurien](https://github.com/mozilla-services/vaurien) and moved on to something else. This is just some very very rough hacking. 

There is also a [Spray](http://spray.io/) based version (in the spray-experiment branch).
